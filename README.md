# Arduino-Security-System
Arduino Uno using an IR receiver, LCD Screen and Ultrasonic Sensor

The system detects whether there is something in the proximity, if the alarm is armed, the alarm goes off. If it is disarmed, nothing happens.
After it goes off it can be disarmed using the remote control, and than subsequently re armed and disarmed at will.
